Description:
    Stubs out a new cassandra migration. 
    
    Pass the migration name, either CamelCased or under_scored. A migration
    class is generated in db/cassandra_migrate, prefixed by a timestamp of the
    current date and time

Example:
    rails generate cassandra_migration create_tweets

    This will create:
      db/cassandra_migrate/20080514090912_create_tweets.rb
      
    Inside this file we'll have a migration ready for completion:
      class CreateTweets << CassandraMigrations::Migration
        def up

        end
        
        def down
        
        end
      end
